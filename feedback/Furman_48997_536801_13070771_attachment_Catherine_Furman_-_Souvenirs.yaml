    comments: Well-written, thoughtful, and engaging reflection. The ideas are clearly expressed. Minor proofreading for typos ("Spnaish," "quianitfying," "fuliemtn," etc.) would elevate it further.

  Hi Catherine,

  This is a really strong reflection! I was particularly impressed by how thoughtfully you engaged with both the back-translation exercise and the reading on the Netherlands. You drew insightful connections between language, culture, societal structures, and the complex concept of happiness, demonstrating a deep engagement with the course material. It's great to see you explicitly connecting these ideas to your own evolving understanding of the "Good Life" and recognizing how your perspective is shifting â€“ that's exactly what these reflections are for.

  As a small point for future submissions, taking a moment to proofread for minor typos would add an extra layer of polish to your already excellent work. Keep up the thoughtful engagement!
