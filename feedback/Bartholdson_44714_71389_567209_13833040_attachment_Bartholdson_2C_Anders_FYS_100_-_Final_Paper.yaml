    comments: Your project proposal makes connections to the course themes on the "good life" and happiness, explicitly linking your research question to topics discussed in FYS 100. Placing this connection even more prominently in the introduction could further strengthen the proposal's framing.

  Anders, this is a very strong and well-developed proposal! You've clearly put a lot of thought into your research question, linking it directly back to our FYS discussions on happiness and the good life. To make the proposal even stronger, consider bringing the connection to the course themes and the central idea of exploring well-being and education more prominently into the introduction, rather than embedding it deeper in the project description. This would help clarify the core motivation right from the start.

  Your detailed itinerary outlining specific places and people you hope to engage with is a significant strength of this proposal. The plan to visit both urban and rural areas in each country and speak with a range of individuals from government officials to students is comprehensive. The budget is also well-researched and appears realistic for the proposed trip.

  One area to double-check is the final formatting and page count to ensure it fully meets the 2-3 page requirement. Also, while your ambition to interview high-level officials like the Minister of Education is commendable, it can be challenging to secure access. Consider having backup plans or alternative interview subjects within relevant organizations (e.g., Ministry staff, university researchers focused on education policy) in case direct access isn't possible.

  Overall, this is a compelling proposal for a unique and interesting research project!
