  Hi David,

  This is an excellent "Souvenir" reflection! You've done a wonderful job engaging deeply with this week's materials, particularly the concepts from *The Geography of Bliss* and the discussions around the Dutch approach to happiness. I was impressed by how clearly you articulated the connections between societal structures (like social safety nets and work-life balance) and national well-being, and how you thoughtfully related the theme of human connection back to your own experiences.

  It's also great to see you explicitly reflecting on how the course content is challenging and expanding your own understanding of the 'good life' and the cultural factors that shape it. Keep up this high level of insightful and personal reflection!
