    comments: Your project makes connections to the Good Life by exploring childhood experiences and well-being, but these could be more explicit and clearly linked to course themes. The importance of childhood well-being is key to the Good Life, as discussed in class, and making these links stronger would improve the proposal.

  Overall, Nina, this is a compelling and well-articulated proposal for a project exploring child welfare in Costa Rica. Your passion for child advocacy is evident, and I appreciate the connection you make between this project and your goals as a student and beyond; this helps demonstrate the contribution this experience will have on your personal and professional development.

  A key strength of your proposal is the detailed plan you've outlined, including specific organizations you intend to visit and individuals you hope to interview.

  One area for improvement would be to strengthen the connection to "The Good Life." While you touch upon how early experiences impact well-being, this connection feels a bit thin and could be expanded and underscored. The importance of childhood well-being and growing up in a healthy environment is a key component of the "Good Life," and we made connections (explicit and implicit) between these ideas during the semester. Making those links more explicit in your proposal would be beneficial. Another area for improvement is expanding the written report section to ensure it meets the 2-3 page length requirement (single-spaced). You could add more detail about the specific questions you plan to ask, delve deeper into the challenges of researching this topic, or elaborate on how you will navigate potential language barriers beyond mentioning you have a foundation in Spanish. Additionally, clarifying the timeline for contacting your middle school connections to secure necessary permissions and contacts *before* your trip begins would strengthen the feasibility of your plan. Keep up the great work!
