    comments: You included the project title, country, and a clear synopsis of your proposed research question and project goals.

    points: 3.0
    comments: While the idea that sports foster social connection is relevant, the proposal needs a more explicit connection to course themes regarding the Good Life. It's unclear how the research specifically contributes to understanding the Good Life or how data will be collected to support these claims.

    comments: Your budget is realistic, detailed, and clearly itemizes costs associated with travel, lodging, research activities, and daily expenses, staying within the $6000 limit.

    comments: The report follows the requested structure and formatting. However, significant claims about the importance of golf to Irish culture and community lack citations. Such claims require evidence and should not be presented as common knowledge.

    comments: The itinerary lists locations, but the rationale for choosing these specific sites needs clarification. It's unclear what you expect to find at each location, how visiting each contributes to your overall goals, and specifically how you plan to collect and analyze data/observations there.

    comments: The proposal shows passion but needs strengthening. The central argument linking a single sport (golf) to national well-being is tenuous and requires stronger theoretical grounding and citations. The connection to course themes and the methodology need clearer articulation.

  Rhodes, this proposal reflects your genuine passion for golf. However, while the idea that sports can foster social connection and community is powerful, the proposal requires significant refinement to meet the criteria for a Richter project, particularly regarding its connection to course themes and research methodology.

  Key areas for improvement include:

  1.  **Strengthening the Connection to The Good Life:** The link between golf in Ireland and the concept of the Good Life needs to be much more explicit and grounded in course discussions. It's currently unclear what your research aims to contribute to our understanding of the Good Life and how the data you propose to collect will specifically support your claims.
  2.  **Supporting Claims with Evidence:** Statements about the importance of golf to Irish community and culture need citations. These are significant claims presented as common knowledge, but they require evidence. The broader notion that one sport heavily influences the well-being of an entire nation is tenuous and needs much stronger justification and support.
  3.  **Clarifying Methodology and Rationale:** The rationale for choosing specific golf courses needs to be clearer. Explain *why* each location was selected, what you expect to find there that is relevant to your research question, *how* you will collect data/observations at each site (beyond just visiting), and how you plan to analyze this information to draw conclusions about the Good Life.

  Addressing these points will help develop a more focused, academically grounded, and feasible research plan aligned with the goals of the Richter program and our course.
