    points: 4.0
    comments: You clearly included your project title, the country (Kenya, compared to the US), and a thorough 3-4 sentence synopsis covering social media's political and daily life impact, user differences, and platform use.

    points: 3.0
    comments: Your project lacks focus and attempts to approach too many angles and lacks a clear trajectory to contribute to a better undertanding of the Good Life. There are definitely aspects, many in fact, that could be viable, but taken together the proposal false short of being convincing.

    comments: You provided a realistic and detailed budget, including categories like airfare, housing, food, internet, transportation, and miscellaneous costs. The total is calculated and within the maximum request.

    comments: The written conventions are met and the text length appears sufficient for the requested page count.
  "1744995383766":
    points: 3.0
    comments: Your plan outlines key activities (visiting U Nairobi, seeking women politicians) but could be strengthened by detailing *how* you plan to collect and analyze data (e.g., interview methods, data analysis techniques). The current description lacks specific methodological steps.

    points: 3.0
    comments: While thoughtful and engaging, the proposal's structure is somewhat disjointed, covering many angles (education, gender, politics) without a clear, focused methodology. Clarifying the data collection/analysis plan and perhaps structuring the proposal with distinct sections (Background, Methods, etc.) would improve overall quality.

  Emma, your proposal addresses an interesting and timely topic, connecting social media use in Kenya to your academic interests and potentially to broader course themes. The basic information is present, and the budget appears well-researched.

  However, the proposal needs significant refinement to be convincing. As noted in the rubric, it currently lacks focus, attempting to cover too many disparate angles (education, gender, politics) without a clear, unifying research trajectory. This diffusion makes it difficult to see how the project, as currently conceived, would contribute meaningfully to understanding the "Good Life" or related course concepts.

  A major area for improvement is the methodology. While you mention visiting the University of Nairobi and seeking out politicians, the proposal lacks crucial details about *how* you plan to collect information (e.g., specific interview questions, observation techniques) and, importantly, *how* you intend to analyze the data you gather. A clear plan for data collection and analysis is essential for a viable research proposal.

  Furthermore, the overall structure feels disjointed. Organizing the proposal with distinct sections (like Background, Research Questions, Methods, Budget) would likely help clarify your thinking and make the project plan much easier for a reader to follow. Focusing your research question, clearly outlining your methodological approach, and improving the structure will be key steps in strengthening this proposal. Remember to also ensure the final document meets all formatting requirements.
