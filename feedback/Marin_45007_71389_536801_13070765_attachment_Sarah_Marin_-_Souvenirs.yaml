  Hi Sarah,

  This is a great start to your "Souvenirs" reflections! You've done a nice job engaging directly with the course material, specifically the *Geography of Bliss*, and articulating how your understanding of "happiness" and the "good life" is expanding beyond a simple emotion. It's wonderful that you're noticing the significant differences across cultures and the nuances in how these concepts are discussed linguistically â€“ that shows strong engagement with the course's themes.

  To continue developing your reflections throughout the semester, consider deepening the connection between the course material and your own personal experiences. While you mention a shift in your understanding, think about concrete examples or specific thoughts/feelings that arose while reading or discussing these topics. How do the Dutch ideas of leisure and tolerance specifically intersect with or diverge from *your* lived experience or observations of American life? Pushing for this level of personal connection will help make your reflections even more insightful and demonstrate significant personal growth.

  Keep up the thoughtful work!
