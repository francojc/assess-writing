*In what follows, reflect on your learning and personal growth at this
point in our course. Consider this week's readings, multimedia sources,
presentations, discussions, activities, etc. To your best ability
attempt to integrate these experiences into our own developing
understanding of the 'Good Life'.*

**At the start of this course, I hadn't thought twice about the concept
of happiness as more than just an emotion. But throughout the last few
weeks of this course, my knowledge on happiness has expanded ten fold.
The differences across the world when it comes to happiness are very
shocking yet somewhat expected. The first chapter of Weiner's *The
Geography of Bliss* on the Netherlands really highlighted the contrast
of beliefs around the world. Their idea of the "good life" was centered
around leisure and tolerance while American's value a more fast paced
and definitely less tolerant lifestyle. The focus on the linguistic
aspect of happiness has also been really interesting. Sometimes they
refer to contentment rather than elation or joy rather than peace. So
far I've learned that happiness and the "good life" are not universal
concepts - although they are very similar. I believe that throughout
this course I will learn even more about what the "good life" is.**
