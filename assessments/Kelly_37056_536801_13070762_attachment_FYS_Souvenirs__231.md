Hi Gibby,

This is an excellent first "Souvenir" reflection! You've done a fantastic job engaging thoughtfully with the course material, particularly the concepts around quantifying happiness and societal pressures. Your reflection on the role of social media, drawing direct connections to your own experiences with Instagram validation, was especially insightful and powerful. It clearly demonstrates both strong self-awareness and a willingness to grapple with complex ideas related to the good life.

Your writing is clear and engaging, making your reflections easy to follow. You effectively show how you are processing the course concepts and integrating them into your own understanding, which is exactly the goal of these assignments. Keep up this high level of thoughtful engagement and personal connection in future reflections!
