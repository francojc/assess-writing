Hi Gibby,

This is an excellent first Souvenir reflection! You've done a wonderful job engaging thoughtfully with the course material, particularly the concepts around defining and quantifying happiness, and comparing cultural perspectives. Your reflection is insightful and well-supported.

A real strength here is how effectively you connected the course themes to your personal experiences, especially your candid discussion about social media and its impact on your past view of happiness. This personal connection makes your reflection very compelling and demonstrates strong self-awareness. It's also great to see you reflecting on potential shifts in your own perspective regarding the pursuit of happiness, clearly showing personal growth.

Keep up this level of deep engagement and thoughtful connection in your future reflections! You're off to a fantastic start.
