## Submission comments

Hi Bridget,

This is an excellent reflection! You did a wonderful job synthesizing the ideas from Lomas and the article on the Netherlands, highlighting the contrast between cultural/linguistic perspectives on well-being and quantitative measures. It's particularly great to see you connecting these ideas directly to your own understanding and even bringing them into conversations outside of class â€“ that shows real engagement and learning.

Your writing is clear and thoughtful, demonstrating a strong grasp of the material and its relevance to your developing understanding of the 'Good Life'. Keep up this fantastic level of insightful reflection!
