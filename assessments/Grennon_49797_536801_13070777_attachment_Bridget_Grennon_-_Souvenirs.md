## Submission comments

Hi Bridget,

This is an excellent reflection! You do a fantastic job engaging deeply with the week's materials, particularly in how you contrast the ideas from Lomas and the article on the Netherlands. It's also great to see you connect these concepts so clearly to your own thoughts about language and happiness, and even extend the learning into a conversation outside of class â€“ that's a wonderful sign of integrating these ideas!

As you continue writing these reflections, keep exploring these connections; perhaps consider how specific cultural concepts of well-being (like some Lomas might discuss) could offer new perspectives or nuances to your own developing definition of a 'good life'. Really strong work this week!
