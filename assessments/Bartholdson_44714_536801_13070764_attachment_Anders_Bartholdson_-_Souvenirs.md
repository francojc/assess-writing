| Criterion ID | Description | Points | Comments |
|---|---|---|---|
| _5776 | Reflection | 3.0 | Your reflection touches on specific points from the reading (happiness/suicide rates, Netherlands example) and considers their impact, which is relevant. To improve, try delving deeper into the insights offered by the course material. |
| _5135 | Connection | 3.0 | You clearly connect the course material to your personal perspective, contrasting the Dutch example with your own view ("my American in me talking"). The connection is present but could be explored further for greater depth. |
| _4515 | Growth | 2.0 | While you note a shift in understanding ("worse understanding"), the reflection doesn't clearly articulate how this experience is contributing to your personal growth or evolving thoughts on the good life beyond this initial reaction. |
| _6267 | Overall Quality | 3.0 | The writing is clear and touches on interesting points. However, the reflection feels brief and could benefit from more developed thoughts to enhance engagement and depth. |

## Submission comments

Hi Anders,

Thanks for sharing your reflection this week. It's good to see you engaging directly with the readings and grappling with complex ideas, like the different cultural views of the "good life" and the surprising statistics about happiness and suicide rates. Your comparison of the description of life in the Netherlands with your own perspective provides a clear personal connection.

Moving forward, I encourage you to expand on these initial thoughts. Consider exploring *how* encountering these different perspectives might be shaping your own definition of the good life or prompting personal growth, even if it initially feels like you have a "worse understanding" (which is often a sign of deeper learning!). Adding a bit more detail and development to your reflections will make them even stronger. Keep up the thoughtful engagement!
