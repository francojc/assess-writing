| Criterion ID | Description | Points | Comments |
|---|---|---|---|
| _5776 | Reflection | 4.0 | Your reflection thoughtfully engages with the reading, particularly noting the complexity of defining the "Good Life" and the happiness/suicide paradox. You show insight by questioning different models, like the one observed in the Netherlands. Further depth could explore these ideas even more. |
| _5135 | Connection | 4.0 | You clearly connect the course material to your own perspective, using phrases like "my American in me" to contextualize your reaction to the Netherlands example. The contrast you draw with your own need for productivity versus constant relaxation is a good personal connection. |
| _4515 | Growth | 3.0 | You articulate a shift in understanding ("worse understanding" due to complexity), which is a valid part of the learning process. However, the reflection could more explicitly connect these insights to your personal growth journey or evolving definition of the good life. |
| _6267 | Overall Quality | 4.0 | The reflection is well-written, clear, and presents thoughtful points concisely. Expanding on some of your observations would add more depth and further enhance engagement. |

## Submission comments

Hi Anders,

Thanks for sharing your reflection this week. It's great to see you grappling with the complexities of the "Good Life" presented in the readings â€“ recognizing that understanding can become *less* clear as we learn more is a valuable insight in itself! You do a good job connecting the material to your own values, especially when discussing the Netherlands example and productivity.

Moving forward, consider elaborating a bit more on your points to add depth. Also, try explicitly linking the shifts in your understanding (like realizing the diverse views on the good life) to how this might influence your own personal growth or perspective beyond just the intellectual understanding of the topic. Keep up the thoughtful engagement!
