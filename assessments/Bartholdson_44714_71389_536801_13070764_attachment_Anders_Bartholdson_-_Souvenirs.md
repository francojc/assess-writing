| Criterion ID | Description | Points | Comments |
|---|---|---|---|
| _5776 | Reflection | 4.0 | You engage directly with specific points from the reading, such as the diversity of "good life" views and the happiness/suicide rate paradox. Consider exploring *why* these points are particularly insightful or challenge common assumptions. |
| _5135 | Connection | 4.0 | You make a clear connection between the course material (the Dutch example) and your own perspective, explicitly framing it through your "American in me" observation. Minor room to elaborate slightly on how this perspective shapes your view. |
| _4515 | Growth | 3.0 | You reflect on how the material impacts your understanding, noting that it complicates the idea of the "Good Life." To strengthen this criterion, consider how this realization of complexity specifically relates to your *personal* growth or evolving perspective on what the "good life" might mean for *you*. |
| _6267 | Overall Quality | 3.0 | The reflection is clear and flows logically from engaging with the material to your personal reaction. It is adequately written and easy to follow. |

## Submission comments
Hi Anders, this is a good start to your reflection! It's great to see you engaging directly with the reading and connecting specific examples, like the differing views on the good life and the Dutch example, to your own thoughts and feelings. Making these personal connections is a key part of the "Souvenirs" assignment.

For future reflections, try to push a bit further on the "Growth" criterion. You noted that the material made you feel you have a "worse understanding" because it highlighted complexity. This is an important realization! Now, consider how that complexity might actually represent growth in your thinking â€“ perhaps recognizing that the good life isn't simple or universal, or how understanding different perspectives might broaden your own view. Explicitly linking these insights back to shifts or developments in your personal perspective will help strengthen this area. Keep up the thoughtful engagement!
