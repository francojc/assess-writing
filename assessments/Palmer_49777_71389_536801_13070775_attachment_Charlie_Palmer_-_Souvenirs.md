## Submission comments
Hi Charlie, thanks for sharing your reflections this week. It's great to see you engaging with the "Geography of Bliss" readings and noting how they are already starting to shape your understanding of what the "Good Life" might entail. It's totally normal for our initial ideas to be challenged as we encounter new perspectives â€“ that's a key part of this course!

For future reflections, I'd encourage you to focus a bit more on the "personal connection" piece. Think about how the specific ideas you're learning about (like the role of tolerance or money in the Netherlands' happiness) directly relate to your *own* experiences, values, or observations in your life. How do these concepts resonate with *you* personally? Connecting the course material more explicitly to your personal world will help deepen your reflection and demonstrate your personal growth throughout the semester. Keep up the good work!
