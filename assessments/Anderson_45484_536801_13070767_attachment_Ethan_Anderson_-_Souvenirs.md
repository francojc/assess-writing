## Submission comments

Hi Ethan,

Thanks for this thoughtful reflection on your first full week engaging with the course material! It's great to see you actively thinking about how the course structure (independent work + discussion) impacts your learning and engagement. Your specific reflections on the Netherlands reading, particularly the concepts of tolerance and indifference, and the linguistics presentation show strong engagement with the content.

One strength here is your self-awareness about what helps you learn and think critically. Another is your willingness to connect the course topics to your own perspectives, like considering your own levels of tolerance. As you continue with these reflections, consider pushing just a bit further on the growth aspect â€“ for instance, *how* did reflecting on tolerance/indifference potentially shift or deepen your understanding of your own values or your concept of the 'good life'? Keep up the great engagement!
