## Submission comments

Hi David,

This is an excellent reflection! You do a wonderful job synthesizing the different course materials from the week, including the readings on the Dutch model of happiness, the World Database of Happiness, and the language exercise. It's particularly strong how you connect these concepts back to your own experiences and clearly articulate how your perspective on the 'good life' is evolving as a result of the course content.

Your thoughtful engagement with the material is evident, especially in how you consider happiness as a social, cultural, and linguistic construct. Keep up this high level of insightful work in future reflections!
