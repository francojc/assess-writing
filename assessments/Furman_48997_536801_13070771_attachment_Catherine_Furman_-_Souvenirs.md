## Submission comments

Hi Catherine,

This is an excellent reflection! You demonstrate a strong ability to engage deeply with the course materials, particularly the back-translation exercise and the reading on happiness in the Netherlands. It's great to see you thoughtfully analyzing how language and societal structures shape our understanding and experience of happiness.

Your connections between these concepts and your own evolving perspective on the "Good Life" and personal well-being are exceptionally clear and insightful. Keep exploring these connections as the course progresses! As a small suggestion for future submissions, taking a moment to proofread for minor typos will help ensure your writing is as polished as your thinking. Well done this week!
