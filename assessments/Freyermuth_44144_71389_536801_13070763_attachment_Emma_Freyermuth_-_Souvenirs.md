## Submission comments
Hi Emma, thank you for submitting your reflection! You've done a great job this week engaging with the various topics we covered, from search strategies and linguistics to cultural perspectives on happiness. I particularly appreciate how you've grappled with the core challenge the course introduces â€“ the difficulty in defining and measuring something as complex as the "good life," especially when considering different languages and cultures. Your questions at the end are thoughtful and show you're really thinking deeply about the material.

As we continue through the semester, I encourage you to push your reflections even further by bringing your personal experiences and current understanding more explicitly into conversation with the course content. Think about how what we discuss resonates with *you* and how it specifically shapes *your personal* journey toward understanding the good life and your own growth. Keep up the insightful thinking!
