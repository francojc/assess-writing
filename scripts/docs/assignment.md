**"Souvenirs": Weekly reflections**

Details: These reflections provide students with an opportunity to reflect on their learning and personal growth throughout the course. This assessment is designed to help students develop their self-awareness and metacognitive skills.

Students will complete reflections on the readings and multimedia sources in this class. These reflections will, at times, integrate course material into students’ own understanding of the good life (e.g., identifying narratives of the “good life” in other cultures and comparing/contrasting how those narratives intersect with or diverge from their own).
