    comments: Your itinerary is comprehensive, detailing locations, timeline, and broad activities (observational research, content analysis). However, the plan could be significantly strengthened by explicitly detailing *what* specific data you will collect (e.g., types of observations, specific content for analysis), *how* it will be collected systematically, and *how* you will analyze it.

    comments: The proposal is well-written, clear, and engaging. Your research question is compelling. In general, the plan is thoughtful. However, adding methodological specifics (data collection/analysis) would further enhance its quality.

  Catherine, this project proposal shows a lot of potential! Your basic information is clear, and your synopsis provides a strong overview of your research question. You've done a good job connecting your project directly to themes of "The Good Life," particularly regarding authenticity, happiness, and the challenges to well-being posed by digital culture.

  However, the proposal lacks important details about your methodology, as noted in the rubric. Explicitly describing *what* specific data you intend to collect (e.g., types of social media interactions, observational contexts), *how* you'll systematically gather it, and the methods you'll use for *analysis* would clarify the scope and enhance the rigor of your research plan. While the topic and connection to the Good Life are strong, fleshing out these methodological fundamentals will make the proposal even more convincing.

  Overall, this is a thoughtful, engaging, and well-structured proposal for an ambitious and valuable project. Good work!
