*In what follows, reflect on your learning and personal growth at this
point in our course. Consider this week's readings, multimedia sources,
presentations, discussions, activities, etc. To your best ability
attempt to integrate these experiences into our own developing
understanding of the 'Good Life'.*

This week, we travelled to India to see how they perceive the "good
life". Mary Alice and I had the tour guide this week and we highlighted
a couple of things that are staples in Indian philosophy:

-   Harmony and chaos happily coexist in India because of their deep
    roots in their spirituality.

-   Committing to service/duty and strengthening religious beliefs is at
    the core of Indian ideals.

-   Practicing letting things go and letting life take its course makes
    staying present in the moment a lot easier.

-   Committing yourself to living a life with many contradictions makes
    you more flexible and resilient as a whole.

These four things (in my opinion and per Weiner's description in the
chapter) encapsulate what the Indian "good life" is. After we spent time
on the reading, prof. McMahan went into more detail about the more
unhinged idea of the "good life" in cults, communes, and "utopias". They
commonly believe in shared resources/ideas, the hive mind mentality,
isolation, strict adherence to a set of rules, and are oftentimes under
the rule of an authoritarian leader. These ideas are definitely not
grouped in with what people would think the "good life" is. But it is
reality and some people do sadly fall into these groups in search of a
life purpose. The Indian "good life" is all about juxtaposition but
finding peace through it all. The values of their society have had
crossovers with other places we have covered thus far, and I'm curious
to see how Weiner's view on American society will tie into all of the
others.
