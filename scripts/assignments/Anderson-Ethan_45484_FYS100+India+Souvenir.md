To start, as always, a reflection on the reading: I went into Weiner's
chapter on India quite skeptical at first, especially considering how
the country's cultural and historical complexity is often reduced to
flat stereotypes in Western culture. However, learning about Weiner's
history reporting in the country put me at ease, and I was additionally
pleased by his decision to live in both an ashram and an artist's
retreat during his visit. I feel that these intentional circumstances
helped elevate Weiner's assessment of India to a level of analysis
unrealized elsewhere in the book; whereas other chapters revolved
entirely around Weiner getting his bearings and interviewing assorted
residents, his prior experience with India allows him to take on more
culturally specific + significant endeavors and question his
relationship to the country more deeply.

Although I was unable to attend class for the first segment of this
week's programming, I find that I was quite fascinated by the focus on
utopias and communes and wish I could have attended the first lecture
covering the subject! I don't love how the history of these
organizations often leans into the absurdity or violence of the most
infamous examples, but as a study of how and why we humans form
societies, they are incomparably intriguing cases. Within our podcast
listening, I was especially drawn by the distinction made between the
ideas of a "cult" and a "commune", and what it reveals about how the
connotations of society can vary opinions on otherwise similar concepts.

I found it personally difficult to conceptualize my own ideas of a
utopian society; perhaps I'm more of a follower in that respect? I enjoy
taking on leadership roles in pre-existing structures, but I find the
idea of reinventing the wheel of civilization more daunting than
invigorating. I think there's a lot of hubris involved in taking on that
level of systematic responsibility, but I can empathize with the passion
that leads people to do it. I've also observed that there tends to be a
lot of unearned stigma directed towards members of these communities,
present or former, for perceived na√Øvete or ignorance. Overall, though,
I found this treatment of the subject to be very insightful both in
looking at historical organizational patterns and the varied rhetorics
behind creating each utopia.
