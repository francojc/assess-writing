> This week, Weiner visits India, where he visits both an ashram and an
> anti-ashram to see the different ways of achieving happiness. The
> ashram is a self-contained group that lives together and shares the
> same belief. The week\'s most interesting part was our Friday lecture
> about different cults throughout history. I found it very interesting
> that many of the cults are formed around saving themselves from the
> world ending. This was very interesting to me because often the end
> goal was eternal happiness, and the people in these cults wanted
> eternal happiness so bad that they often were involved in mass
> suicides. This was very intiguing to me since it shows just how far
> some people will go to be happy, which just adds a interesting
> perspective as we look at what the "good life" really looks like.
